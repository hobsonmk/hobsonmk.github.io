			<p>I am 23 years old, and I have been photographing sports since age 15.  I attended Triton High School in Erwin, NC.  At Triton, I was on the Yearbook Staff for four years and was named Photography Editor my senior year.
			</p>


			<p>In high school, I spent much of my time on the sidelines of games, as a manager/bookkeeper for basketball and baseball and as a photographer for all sports.  As a senior in high school, I was shooting sports photos for the Dunn Daily Record, a local newspaper.
			</p>


			<p>I attended Appalachian State University for two years, during which time I photographed sports for ASU's Sports Information.  I was also enrolled in the Photography program at Appalachian State.
			</p>


			<p>My junior year in college, I transferred to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I began studying Photojournalism.  As a senior, I began a student internship in the Carolina Men's Basketball Office, where I continue to work today.  I have photographed on the sidelines of many UNC athletic events, including Men's Basketball, Women's Basketball, Football and Softball.  In 2016, I was hired as the official photographer for the Roy Williams Basketball Camp.
			</p>


			<p>Many photographs from all of these experiences can be found throughout the website.  Please <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me if you have any questions about my photos or services.
